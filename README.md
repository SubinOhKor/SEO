# SEO Optimization and Importance of Off-Site
Anyone who has run a business will be aware of the importance of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) in marketing. Of course, there are people who say, “Can’t you just pay and do Power Link Advertising (PPC)?!” If you can afford to spend millions or tens of millions of won in marketing expenses leaking out of PowerLink per month, then you don't need to study SEO headaches.





Customers trust site links they find more than Powerlinks.

People already perceive Power Link as a typical advertising medium. Consider the 5A stage of Philip Kotler's <Market 4.0> (cognition - liking - question - action - advocacy). In the cognitive stage, people see hundreds of thousands of advertisements, and thousands of 5A path deviate from this place. If someone enters a keyword into the search bar and searches for it, this person is in the favorable stage and is a customer with a high probability of leading to action (purchase). The reason why the company should be exposed at the top of the site list that appears when a keyword is searched is to avoid missing out on these customers.

SEO consists of three main categories (On-Server, On-Site, Off-Site), and we will look at each optimization method one by one.

# On-Server SEO
Search optimization on a per-server basis


1) Website format: Website in html format

2) URL address system

- The length of the URL address should be as short as possible.

- Depth(/) is recommended for 2~4, less than 6

- URLs with variable values: Prohibit the use of parameters (variable values, special symbols such as !$#%) in the URL

- URL Naming: It is very advantageous to include keywords indicating the topic of the page.

- URL Rewriting: If there is a problem with the above address system, use the URL rewriting technique

- Do not use underscores: Use dashes (-) instead of underscores (_) to separate words.

- Domain: .com is the most SEO advantageous TLD. However, if .com is not available, use .net, .org, .co or ccTLD.

3) Folder/File Naming

4) Site speed: Go to https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ , a speed measurement tool provided by Google,  and enter the website address to analyze solutions for speed and speed improvement. It is recommended to improve the speed of the site mainly by using techniques such as image size and separate JavaScript processing.

5) Compliance with web standards: If web standards are complied with, the site will look compatible even if different browsers are used. Web standard problems and solutions for my site can be checked through http://validator.w3.org.

6) Programming elements such as Javascript processing

7) XML sitemap: Create an XML sitemap (sitemap.xml) and upload it to the root directory server so that the Google search robot can search more pages in your site.

* XML Sitemap Creation Tool: If you search for XML Sitemap or XML Sitemap Generator in the Google search bar, you can create it using a free tool.

* Upload Google/Naver Webmaster Tools Site Ownership Document Upload the Google/Naver html authentication document for site ownership verification to the root directory.

8) Robot tag: robots.txt - Upload the robots.txt file to the root directory.

9) Compatibility with Mobile Devices (Responsive Web): For the mobile compatibility test provided by Google, visit https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/ and enter the site address. If the message that it is optimized for mobile does not appear, it is necessary to improve the site or create a new one.

# On-Site SEO
It is a search optimization of the html source of a web page.


1) Content and keywords

- It should contain high-quality text, image, and video content.

- Throughout the content, reflect key keywords in key positions on the web page.

- Keywords are dense and placed in front. The density is 2 bytes per word for Hangul and 1 byte for each alphabet.



2) <head> area: Optimize title tag and meta tag

* Utilization of title tag
- Title tags appear in search results (SERPs), social links, and web browser tabs.

- Be sure to include key keywords, and it is recommended to include them at the beginning.

- Avoid repeatedly using keywords for high exposure and maintain an appropriate length (less than 80 characters).

- Each page should have its own title tag and meta tag, and core keywords should be included.

- Example of homepage title tag: <title>Pet Planet | Premium care from a professional pet sitter</title>



 * Use of meta tags
- This is an advertisement that induces users to click on a web page, although it has nothing to do with search rank.

- Include important target keywords in the text to increase the click-through rate and make it stand out.

-Work so that each web page has its own meta description tag.

- Example of Meta Description <meta name="description" content="Write readable within 80 characters including spaces, including key keywords.">

- Use of meta keywords <meta name="keywords" content="Pet sitter, pet planet, visiting pet sitter, dog caretaker, dog caretaker, dog pet sitter">



* Utilization of Open Graph tag
Write the same as the title and meta tag, and the size of the image is 1200 X 628 (px)



Utilization of Canonical url tag
-Use canonical url to set representative url for all web pages of website.

- Add <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.petplanet.co" /> to <head> of homepage





3) HTML tag inside the <body> area

- Since the search robot mainly recognizes text, it is better to write it in text instead of an image.

- Keywords should also be placed in an appropriate position and balanced.



* Utilization of Heading tag and Paragraph tag
- Displays keywords and importance of content, not font size.

 - <h1> must include key keywords and is used as the most important headline tag on a web page.

 - <h2> is a tag for expressing subheadline phrases, and it is good to reflect key keywords.

- <h3> is the subheadline tag of the subheadline.

- It is also important to melt key keywords in <p>.

- Keep the main keyword density at 3-8%, and if the total keyword density exceeds 15%, it is recognized as spam. (Search the Keyword Density Checker site on Google for reference)



* Use of anchor tag tag
 - Hyperlinks use anchor tags.



* Utilization of img tag alt attribute
- It refers to the alt attribute value of the img tag that describes the image used in the web page.

- When using an image link, the alt attribute value of the img tag serves as the anchor text.

- Usage: When using a screen reader, when an image does not load, it is helpful when a search engine crawls.

- How to write: Write the explanatory text in detail including key keywords, but avoid overlapping keywords.

* It is also helpful to save the image file name as a key keyword or meaningfully.

Ex) <img src="Pet Planet pet sitter training.png" alt="A preliminary pet sitter taking a class at the 1st Pet Planet pet sitter training site">
  
  # Off-Site SEO
Diversify and upgrade the inbound links to your website


External optimization is the part that plays an important role enough to be called the flower of SEO. If On-Server and On-Site SEO buy exercise equipment to lose weight, Off-Site SEO actually works out to lose weight.



1) Anchor text used for external links

2) Popularity of external links (quantity and quality are important)

3) Guided links from trusted domains

(After checking the domain authority level by searching for Domain Authority Checker in Google, the link should be derived from a domain higher than ours)

  # Performance through SEO should be measured


1) Increased number of impression keywords and high traffic

Ex) 00 keywords have a higher ranking than before SEO, and new traffic has been created with 00 keywords.

When analyzing search engine optimization (SEO) performance using Google Analytics (GA), you need to interpret numbers well. #From a search engine optimization perspective, the bounce rate is approached from the perspective of the first page, and the exit rate is measured by substituting it for all situations, whether it's the first page or the second page. It is said that performance is good when these two are unconditionally low, but paradoxically, in order to achieve the KPI perfectly, there are cases in which exit and termination must be rather increased.


2) Page registration ranking

When a site is found in a search engine, it can be said that SEO performance is good if the site is located in a high place.
4) EPR (Electronic Press Release) distribution
  
  If SEO is difficult,


Outsource it to a developer with knowledge of SEO, or use a CMS (Contents Management System) to build your website. CMS is a place that makes websites with high SEO and compatibility like WordPress and Joomla.
